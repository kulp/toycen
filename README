toycen aspires to be a C compiler written in C that provides me (kulp) a
platform for experimentation, especially in visualisations, and hopefully can
be useful to others, ideally as a teaching tool. I don't pretend to have a very
approachable coding style, so the usefulness of the code as it exists at the
moment (ignoring its incompleteness) may be limited.

At the moment, toycen doesn't compile anything, and it doesn't even have a
backend. It can parse preprocessed C89 mostly, and construct an AST. Stay tuned
for exciting future developments !
